# SuperScheduler

SuperScheduler is an online calendar that programmatically takes two years of future dates and allows the user to book blocks in one hour increments. The user can also input a short title and event description.

# Step 1: Open Calendar

Open the calendar locally -- you should automatically see the calendar present the current week.

# Step 2: Book a Block

Click on the "Book" button for any specific day and time increment. A Modal should pop up prompting you to enter a title and description.

# Step 3: Exit Modal

After booking, that specific time increment's button text should change from "Book" to "Booked".

# Future Iterations

In future versions, I would want to integrate the following features:

1) Cancel events
2) More flexible time increments
3) Integration with Google calendar
